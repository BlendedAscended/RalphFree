# RalphFree Project Context
(This file provides context to RalphFree about the project structure and rules)

## Project Rules
1. Always plan before editing.
2. Use minimal tool calls.
3. Be concise.
4. When executed via an `/ralph` command inside OpenCode, respect that OpenCode aggregates the final output. Always maintain the strict Plan -> Execute -> Reflect loop, keeping physical edits isolated if the `--isolate` flag was passed.
